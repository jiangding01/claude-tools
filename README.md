A curated collection of Claude Code extensions — Skills, Hooks, custom commands, and more.

## Skills

Skills are prompt + script bundles that extend Claude Code's capabilities. Once installed, they are triggered automatically when Claude recognizes a matching request.

## Installation

### Option 1: Remote install (recommended)

Install any skill directly with a single command — no cloning required:

```bash
npx skills add JiangDing1990/claude-tools --skill weixin-article-fetcher
npx skills add JiangDing1990/claude-tools --skill r2-upload
```

Restart Claude Code and the skill is ready to use.

### Option 2: Manual install

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JiangDing1990/claude-tools.git

# 2. Copy the skill directory into Claude Code's skills path
cp -r claude-tools/skills/weixin-article-fetcher ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart Claude Code — skills are auto-loaded from `~/.claude/skills/`.
